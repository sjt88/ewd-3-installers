# ewd-3-installers: Pre-built automated installers for creating working EWD 3 systems
 
This repository contains installers for creating ready-to-run EWD 3 systems.  They are ideal for anyone
new to EWD 3 and Cache or GT.M who wants to quickly discover how it works etc.  They are also a great way to quickly get a
working system up and running that you can then adapt and customise.

The installers are for use with Linux systems, virtual machines or Amazon EC2 instances.

Use them as a starting point and guide for creating customised systems and/or for installing EWD 3 on systems that already 
include Node.js, Cache or GT.M

## Using the Installers

### Installing ewd-xpress with the GT.M Database

On a Ubuntu system:

     cd ~
     sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install git
     git clone https://github.com/robtweed/ewd-3-installers
     source ewd-3-installers/ewd-xpress/install_gtm.sh

### Installing ewd-xpress with the GlobalsDB Database

On a Ubuntu system:

     cd ~
     sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install git
     git clone https://github.com/robtweed/ewd-3-installers
     source ewd-3-installers/ewd-xpress/install_globalsdb.sh

### Installing ewd-xpress with the Cache Database

The install script at https://github.com/robtweed/ewd-3-installers/ewd-xpress/install_globalsdb.sh
 is not intended to be run as a script, but more as a template set of instructions that you should
 use as a baseline and adapt, as appropriate, for your particular system.
